SmartAgri: A Python-Based Web Application with Hedera DLT for Enhanced Agricultural Traceability!(https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen)SmartAgri is a proof-of-concept web application designed to address critical challenges in the agricultural supply chain. By integrating a user-friendly Python web interface with the high-throughput, enterprise-grade Hedera distributed ledger, this project aims to provide an immutable, transparent, and auditable system for tracking agricultural products from farm to consumer, ensuring data integrity and fostering trust among all stakeholders.1The Problem Domain: Challenges in Modern AgricultureThe modern agricultural supply chain is a complex network of producers, distributors, regulators, and consumers. This complexity often leads to significant challenges, including a lack of transparency, susceptibility to fraud, and inefficiencies in data management. Consumers increasingly demand to know the provenance of their food, while regulators require stringent tracking for safety and compliance. Traditional, centralized databases are often siloed and vulnerable to tampering, making it difficult to establish a single, verifiable source of truth for a product's journey. This can result in costly recalls, diminished consumer trust, and difficulties in verifying claims such as "organic" or "sustainably sourced."The Solution: A Hybrid Web & DLT ArchitectureSmartAgri proposes a solution that combines the accessibility of a traditional web application with the security and immutability of a distributed ledger technology (DLT). The project's architecture is twofold: a Python-based web application serves as the user-friendly gateway for data entry and visualization, while the Hedera network acts as the immutable backend for critical data points, ensuring they cannot be altered or deleted.1 This hybrid model offers the best of both worlds: a familiar and intuitive interface for stakeholders to interact with the system, underpinned by a powerful, decentralized layer of trust that guarantees the integrity of the supply chain data.Core Features and CapabilitiesThe functionalities of SmartAgri are divided between the user-facing web portal and the DLT-powered backend.Web Portal FunctionalitiesThe web portal, built using a standard Python web framework, provides the primary interface for users.1 Its features include:User Management: A foundational system for user registration and login, allowing for role-based access control (e.g., farmers, distributors, auditors).Data Dashboard: A central interface where users can view agricultural data, track product batches, and monitor supply chain events in real-time.File Management System: A system for uploading and managing relevant documents, such as organic certifications, harvest reports, or shipping manifests. The presence of an uploads/ directory indicates a built-in capacity for handling user-submitted files.1Hedera DLT-Powered FeaturesThe integration with Hedera, evidenced by the test_hedera.py file, enables the project's most innovative features by providing a secure and transparent ledger.1 The specific capabilities of the Hedera network are leveraged to deliver:Immutable Audit Trails: The application can leverage the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) to create a tamper-proof, chronologically ordered log of every event in a product's lifecycle. This includes events like planting, fertilizing, harvesting, packaging, and shipping, each with a verifiable timestamp.Secure Data Logging: Critical data points, such as soil sensor readings, temperature and humidity levels during transport, or quality control checks, can be submitted as messages to the Hedera network. This provides a verifiable and permanent source of truth for quality assurance, regulatory compliance, and dispute resolution.Asset Tokenization (Potential): The architecture provides a framework for representing real-world agricultural assets (e.g., a specific batch of produce, a shipping container) as unique, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Hedera Token Service (HTS). This would enable transparent, auditable, and efficient transfer of ownership and custody as the asset moves through the supply chain.Technical Architecture and DesignThe project is structured to separate concerns between the web interface, server logic, and DLT interaction.Repository StructureA clear understanding of the repository's layout is essential for navigation and contribution. The file structure points to a classic Python web application architecture.1Table 1: Repository Structure GuideDirectory / FileDescriptionapp.pyThe main application file, likely built with Flask.

Navigate to Project DirectoryBashcd SmartAgri
Create and Activate a Virtual EnvironmentIt is a best practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.On macOS/Linux:Bashpython3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
On Windows:Bashpython -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate```Install DependenciesA requirements.txt file is needed to install the necessary Python packages. If it does not exist, you will need to create one. The project likely depends on the following packages:Flaskpython-dotenvhedera-sdk-pythonOnce the requirements.txt file is present, install the dependencies with:Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
ConfigurationThe application requires Hedera network credentials to interact with the ledger. These should be managed securely using environment variables.Create a .env file in the root of the project directory.Add your Hedera account ID and private key to this file. Use the .env.example below as a template..env.example# Hedera Network Credentials
# Do not commit the actual.env file to version control!
HEDERA_ACCOUNT_ID=
HEDERA_PRIVATE_KEY=
Important: Add the .env file to your .gitignore file to prevent your private keys from being committed to version control.Running the ApplicationOnce the setup and configuration are complete, you can start the web server:Bashpython app.py
You should see output in your terminal indicating that the server is running, typically on http://127.0.0.1:5000/. You can now access the application by navigating to this address in your web browser.Usage and WorkflowThe application is designed to be used by various stakeholders in the agricultural supply chain.User StoriesAs a Farm Manager: Log in to the portal, navigate to the 'Harvest' section, and submit the details for a new batch of produce, including quantity and harvest date. Upload the organic certification document. Upon submission, a record is immutably stored on the Hedera ledger, and a transaction ID is returned for future reference.As a Supply Chain Auditor: Search for a specific batch of produce using its unique ID. View the complete, timestamped audit trail of its journey, with links to the verifiable transactions on a Hedera network explorer like HashScan or DragonGlass.Screenshots and GIFsContribution and Development RoadmapContributions are welcome!
